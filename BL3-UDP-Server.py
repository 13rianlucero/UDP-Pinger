# Program Information
#   Program Name: UDP-Pinger
#   Purpose: This project utilizes a UDP pinger, a tool designed 
#            to send a UDP packet to a target on an unallocated 
#            port and waits for a specific error answer.

#   Purpose: UDP sender: Send the host name and system time as a message to a 
#            destination host designated by its IP address and port number. Repeat the 
#            transmission when enabled to do so.Read and display the returned messages, 
#            and indicate the IP address and port number of the sender. Also, will keep 
#            track of the RTT values of each ping and give a stats summary at the end, 
#            also indicating if thereâ€™s packet loss.
